## Welcome to my personal page

Hi, and welcome to my personal page! At this point this page is almost empty but I will be working to start adding more stuff here. At some point expect to have guides for Computer Aided Drug Design (CADD) and also expect to have some guides of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) topics.

A little bit about me, I am a PhD candidate in the Molecular Biophysics & Structural Biology (MBSB) Ph.D. program at the University of Pittsburgh. I received my bachelors in Chemistry from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and my M.S. from Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests focus on computer-aided drug discovery, virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulations, weighted ensemble path sampling and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.
