    excerpt: 'Hi, my name is Erich Hellemann. I obtained my Ph.D. working in the laboratory of [Ph.D. Jacob D. Durrant](https://durrantlab.pitt.edu/). My interests focus on computer-aided drug discovery (CADD), virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulations, weighted ensemble path sampling, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) of small molecules. I am also interested in teaching and mentoring as well as programming and all sort of tech topics.<br>

## My career path

Ever since I can remember I loved to solve puzzles. While pursuing my undergrad in Chemistry at Mexico's National University (UNAM) I learned about NMR and found it to be a really interesting and elegant way to solve structural puzzles. This led me to pursue my interest in NMR and worked in the Chemistry Institute at UNAM for Professor Raul Enríquez. During my time in this laboratory, we used isotopic exchange to observe the keto-enol equilibrium with 1D NMR. 

Further pursuing my passion for NMR, I joined the chemistry graduate program at Carnegie Mellon University. I worked for Professor Roberto Gil in the development of methodologies for the use of anisotropic parameters to solve small molecule structures. 

After getting my Master’s degree I had a better appreciation of how NMR could be used to study complex systems, which led me to join Professor Andrew Hinck’s laboratory as a research technician.  As I learned about structural biology, I started to get excited and wanted to learn more about proteins, which led me to join the Molecular Biophysics and Structural Biology program offered at the University of Pittsburgh. In a talk given by a student in Professor Jacob Durrant laboratory, I learned about the computational approaches to help in drug development. I found this to be a really interesting new type of puzzles that I would love to solve. This led me to join the Durrant laboratory, where I developed a tool that leverages Weighted Ensemble simulations to sample protein pocket conformations for their use in ensemble docking. I also worked in the use of molecular dynamics to elucidate the allosteric communications within proteins for the understanding of different types of behaviors due to different perturbations. During my stay at the Durrant lab, I had the opportunity to mentor undergraduates, a really fulfilling opportunity.
