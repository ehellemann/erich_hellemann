    excerpt: 'Hi, my name is Erich Hellemann. I am a PhD candidate working in the laboratory of [PhD. Jacob D. Durrant](https://durrantlab.pitt.edu/). I am a student in the Molecular Biophysics & Structural Biology program. My interests focus on computer-aided drug discovery (CADD), virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulations, weighted ensemble path sampling, and nuclear magnetic resonace (NMR) of small molecules. I am also interested in teaching and mentoring undergraduate students.<br>

## My career path

Ever since I can remember I loved to solve puzzles. While persuing my undergrad in Chemistry at Mexico's National University (UNAM) I learned about NMR and found it to be a really interesting and elegant way to solve structural puzzles. This led me to pursue my interest in NMR and worked in the Chemistry Institute at UNAM for Professor Raul Enríquez. During my time in this laboratory, we used isotopic exchange to observe the keto-enol equilibrium with 1D NMR. 

Further pursuing my passion for NMR, I joined the chemistry graduate program at Carnegie Mellon University. I worked for Professor Roberto Gil in the development of methodologies for the use of anisotropic parameters to solve small molecule structures. 

After getting my Master’s degree I had a better appreciation of how NMR could be used to study complex systems, which led me to join Professor Andrew Hinck’s laboratory as a research technician.  As I learned about structural biology, I started to get excited and wanted to learn more about proteins, which led me to join the Molecular Biophysics and Structural Biology program offered at the University of Pittsburgh. In a talk given by a student in Professor Jacob Durrant laboratory, I learned about the computational apporaches to help in drug development. I found this to be a really interesting new type of puzzles that I would love to solve. This led me to join the Durrant laboratory, where I have been developing a tool that leverages Weighted Ensemble simulations to sample protein pocket conformations for their use in ensemble docking. I have also worked in the use of molecular dynamics to elucidate the allosteric communications within proteins for the understanding of diferent types of behaviours due to different perturbations. During my stay at the lab of Professor Durrant, I had the opportunity to mentor undergraduates, a really fullfiling oportunity.
