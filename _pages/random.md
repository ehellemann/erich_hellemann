## A place of distraction 

Hi, in this place you will find stuff that is not science related. You may encounter cat pictures (especially my cat, since it is the only cat I like) or suggestions for board games, books, or equally random things. I will try to make this section as informal as I can. 

I will start with the picture of my lovely Huitlacoche. Her name comes from the mexican delicacy [Huitlacoche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_smut){:target="_blank"}.
